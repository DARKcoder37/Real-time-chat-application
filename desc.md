The project "Real Time Chat Application" is a Java-based application that enables real-time communication between users. It consists of two main components: client.java and server.java.

Summary of each component:
1. Client.java: This is the client-side application that users interact with. It connects to the server and sends messages to it. The client application also receives messages from the server and displays them to the user.
2. Server.java: This is the server-side application that handles incoming connections from clients. It receives messages from clients and broadcasts them to all connected clients. The server maintains a list of connected clients and manages their connections.

The project utilizes Java Socket Programming for network communication, allowing users to communicate in real-time over a network connection. It's a great example of a simple, interactive, and multithreaded client-server chat application. It project provides a practical understanding of network programming, multithreading, and Java's capabilities in developing real-time applications.
